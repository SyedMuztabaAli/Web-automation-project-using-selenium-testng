# Web-automation-project-using-selenium-testng

Web automation project using selenium and testng on pc_house_bd on the following modules: Registration, Login, Product Selection, Adding to Cart, Checkout.
The website does not have active logout module so I have created 2 xml file.

1. testng.xml : Contains the registration module
2. testngTest.xml : Contains all the other modules (Login, Product Selection, Add to Cart, Checkout)
